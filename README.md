# Healthcare and Machine Learning
In healthcare, machine learning can be used to analyze large amounts of patient data to identify patterns and insights that can assist in clinical decision making

The use of ML in healthcare has the potential to revolutionize the industry by improving patient outcomes, reducing costs, and enhancing the efficiency of clinical decision-making

As the severity of most diseases is highly dependent on rapidly changing environmental conditions, this project aims to predict the possible traits due to which the severity of the diseases might be high. 

For this prototype, we have chosen dengue as our target disease and are predicting the traits for each state depending on the number of dengue cases in that partiular state.

The model has been trained using classification

This project prototype is accesible only through Linux operating system as we have used libraries that are specific to Linux. 

The model accuracy and predictions, statewise traits and graphs showing the number of cases for each state can be seen as the output of the above trained model 

Since this is a Web development project, the access link of the website is unique to each user as it is in prototype phase. 
Hence, to access the link of the webpage, first run the app.py file in linux by giving the command  python app.py
The deployment link will then be active for the user to use.
